# Week Planning

## Planning the week

As information on the possibility of coming into the office is not clear at the moment and changing, the actual planning for the coming week will probably only take place on the weekend, maybe even mostly on Sunday.

### Working hours

Since at leastthe presence time in the office will have to be known before the week starts, a plan who will be in the office and when, will be necessary before the week starts.
Additionally it will be helpful to know the working days of the remote workers to plan bigger tasks.

### Tasks of the week

As this time is likely to have some downtime, because there is no laptop installation work to be done from home and tickets will be fewer, work on documentation and elearning can and should be done. To facilitate this each week needs clear information on what is to be done on this end, how this is to be communicated and documented. This is relevant for other tasks also, but these are the ones that are currently the most pressing.

### Mail on Sunday

Each week starts on Sunday with a general overview on what will happen during the week, what will be epxected, what we will be doing.
As long as there are still people coming into the office, this must include clear information on who will be in the office and who is expected to stay at home.
The process of how we will work during the week will be explained, not ony once, but every time in this mail.
General advice aboout working from home or even health topics that can be related to working from home can be included here.

### Team Meetings and individual meetings

To keep up the social connection that we have from working together in the office, a short live meeting each day could be a good idea.
The same goes for individual meetings. As a team coordinator, I would like to be aware of the psychological condition of my team, so I can treat them according to their needs and strengths and do not overwhelm someone in this scary time. So I will plan an indiviual meeting with each team member per week.
