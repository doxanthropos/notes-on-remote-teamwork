- [MovNat: Natural Movement Workouts](https://www.movnat.com/covid-19-response-maps/)
- [Redefining Strength: Dynamic Warm Up Routine Follow Along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0xtYX1Nf5c) - I like this channel because it contains a lot of helpful information on strength and mobility training and taking care of your helth while doing it. This particula video is a nice 7 minutes warm up that I think can also be used as a standalone excercise during long home office days.
