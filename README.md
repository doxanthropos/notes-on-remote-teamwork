# Notes On Remote Teamwork

This is a notebook mostly for myself, about all the topics aroung managing an (IT-)Team during the COVID-19 crisis.
I set it up here because GH is a good way to version text files and share them between different devices, but as this topic might be relevant for other people too, I think it can't hurt to have it openly accessable.
